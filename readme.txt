Hi and thanks for pulling my repo, here is the information you need to know about this script.

This is a very simple script that put bike animation when logging to your user, so when entering in SSH session too etc...

You need to start the config script first, then all will be setuped, but there is two important things, don't forget to give the script the correct permission (need the writting permission as well : sudo chmod -R 777 motoWelcomeSc/

And second things, user that execute the config script will get the configuration with the .bashrc config, so don't run it with sudo privileges if you want your user to get the right configuration.

Thanks and ride safe !
